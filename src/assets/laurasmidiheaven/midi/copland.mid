You didn't get here on purpose - you've asked for a page that doesn't 
exist here. It's either my mistake or your outdated bookmark.
<p>
The two major sections on this machine are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="/web/19981203062206/http://laurasmidiheaven.simplenet.com/clarinet/">The Clarinet Info Pages</a>
	<li><a href="/web/19981203062206/http://laurasmidiheaven.simplenet.com/OCR">The Online Clarinet Resource</a>
</ul>
<p>
If you were looking for
<b>The Clarinet FAQ</b> (
<i>http://sneezy.mika.com/faq</i> or 
<i>http://sneezy.mika.com/FAQ</i> or
<i>http://sneezy.mika.com/clarinetFAQ</i> or 
<i>http://sneezy.mika.com/clarinetfaq</i> - just a few of the
aliases I was keeping around) - it had been redirected to 
<b>The Clarinet Info Pages</b> for many months; you just never noticed
before. I've changed the Redirect records to no longer do this automatically;
another reason to update your bookmarks.
<p>
Since I recently updated the entire Clarinet Info Pages, there is
a good possiblity that you got here because of my directory/page 
reorganization. I apologize, and hope the new arrangement of pages better 
suits everyone.
<p>
Please update any bookmarks you may have.
<p>
<b>If a link on one of the pages brought you here, please send the name of the offending
page to:</b><br>
